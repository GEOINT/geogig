/**
 * Single cucumber test runner. Its sole purpose is to serve as an entry point for junit. Step
 * definitions and hooks are defined in their own classes so they can be reused across features.
 * 
 * Ignored Tags:
 * <li>FileRepository - these tests are specific to file based repositories
 * <li>ShallowDepth - the MultiRepositoryProvider only serves multiple postgres repos from the same
 * set of tables, therefore it is not possible to create a shallow clone within a test due to the
 * shared object database.
